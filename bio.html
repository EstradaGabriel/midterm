        <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <p><sup>1</sup>I was born in Quezon City, Novaliches, but spent my childhood in Manaoag, Pangasinan.<sup>2</sup> My parents were hardworking entrepreneurs who managed multiple businesses.<sup>3</sup> As the eldest of four siblings, my childhood
                was full of responsibilities and fun.<sup>4</sup> I loved playing with my neighborhood friends until late at night.<sup>5</sup> Our family’s computer shop became my playground, where I developed an early interest in computers.<sup>6</sup>                I also enjoyed building Lego sets and collecting toy cars.<sup>7</sup> Watching Tagalog-dubbed anime with my father became one of my favorite bonding moments.<sup>8</sup> He used to watch anime when he was younger, which influenced my
                love for it.<sup>9</sup> Family trips to San Fabian Beach were always a highlight of my childhood.<sup>10</sup> One of my fondest memories was swimming with my cousins when Mama Alice visited.<sup>11</sup> My lolo and lola also made those
                vacations special with their stories.<sup>12</sup> In school, I was fascinated by science, especially space exploration.<sup>13</sup> I even joined a chess tournament in grade 5 and won a bronze medal.<sup>14</sup> My mother always called
                me "malikot" because I was full of energy.<sup>15</sup> I struggled with speaking up, but I slowly overcame it.<sup>16</sup> One of the best childhood moments was watching the movie *Cars*, which sparked my love for automobiles.<sup>17</sup>                I dreamed of becoming a pilot back then, inspired by the idea of adventure.<sup>18</sup> Looking back, my childhood was simple yet meaningful.<sup>19</sup> It shaped many of the interests I still hold today.<sup>20</sup> My parents’ hard
                work also inspired me to be ambitious and independent.</p>

        <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <p><sup>1</sup> My teenage years were filled with self-discovery and challenges.<sup>2</sup> I attended Our Lady of Manaoag Innovative School for junior high and ASAP for senior high.<sup>3</sup> I was lucky to have a close group of friends from
                childhood.
                <sup>4</sup> My high school principal was an extraordinary teacher who inspired me.<sup>5</sup> I always looked forward to foundation day because it was a break from academics.<sup>6</sup> I joined the school COMELEC as vice governor and
                helped organize elections.<sup>7</sup> I also joined the arts and photography club to explore my creativity.<sup>8</sup> When the pandemic hit, I managed our family’s computer shop.<sup>9</sup> Handling printing, photocopying, and tarpaulin
                layouts taught me responsibility.<sup>10</sup> It was my first real experience in the working world.<sup>11</sup> However, I also faced personal struggles like self-doubt and depression.<sup>12</sup> There were times I questioned whether
                I could achieve my goals.<sup>13</sup> My first heartbreak also happened during this time after pursuing someone for three years.<sup>14</sup> It was painful, but it taught me important lessons about love and respect.<sup>15</sup> Cycling
                became my escape, helping me clear my mind.<sup>16</sup> Photography also became a passion, especially capturing scenic places.<sup>17</sup> I enjoyed uploading my photos to Google Maps to help others navigate.<sup>18</sup> Cooking, especially
                making egg fried rice at midnight, became another hobby.<sup>19</sup> I started believing in life lessons like “it is what it is.”<sup>20</sup> Through all the ups and downs, I grew stronger and more independent.</p>

        <h2>College Years</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <p><sup>1</sup> I am currently a BSIT student at the University of the East.<sup>2</sup> My mother also studied at UE, making it special for me.<sup>3</sup> Growing up around computers made IT a natural choice.<sup>4</sup> Adjusting to college
                life was smooth, though making friends was a bit challenging.<sup>5</sup> Over time, I built meaningful connections with classmates.<sup>6</sup> My college days feel repetitive but rewarding.<sup>7</sup> I enjoy hanging out with my classmates
                after each semester ends.<sup>8</sup> One of the most interesting things I learned was soldering PCB boards.<sup>9</sup> Fixing and modifying mice switches became a small side hobby.<sup>10</sup> My biggest challenge in college is overcoming
                procrastination.
                <sup>11</sup> I’ve learned to manage my time better with a weekly schedule.<sup>12</sup> I am not part of any school organizations, preferring to focus on academics.<sup>13</sup> However, I try to balance studies with social life and hobbies.<sup>14</sup>                My main goal after graduation is to find a stable job.<sup>15</sup> I want to support my family so my parents can finally rest.<sup>16</sup> Beyond that, my long-term dream is to build a man cave underground in my own house.<sup>17</sup>                I also want to own my dream cars someday.<sup>18</sup> These dreams keep me motivated to work hard.<sup>19</sup> College is teaching me the importance of discipline and perseverance.<sup>20</sup> It’s not just about getting a degree but
                building a future for myself and my family.</p>
